In this project I built a Twitter like application based on requirements for a MVP version.
The requirements for this project were:

1. The user logs in to the app, only by typing the username (a proper authenticated login is **not** a requirement).
2. The user is presented with the homepage that includes:
    1. Left-side menu.
    2. *Tweets* tab in the centre.
    3. Right-side section with *Who to follow*.
3. The *Tweets* section includes:
    1. Simple form for creating a tweet.
    2. List of all tweets (sorted by most recent) that display tweet text and author details.
4. The *Who to follow* section includes:
    1. List of profiles that are not followed by the logged-in user (ordered by most recently added).
5. When the user opens the profile page, they can see:
    1. Left-side menu.
    2. Cover picture and *Tweets* tab in the centre.
    3. Right-side section with *Profile detailed info.*
6. The *Profile detailed info* section includes:
    1. User photo.
    2. Button to follow a user.
    3. Stats: total number of tweets, number of followers and number of following users.
    4. List of people who follow this user.
7. At the end extend your MVP app with one simple feature of your choice.
